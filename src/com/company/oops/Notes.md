It is the type of the object(the object of parent or subclass) , which decides the method that is going to be executed .
In a overriding function , private methods in the parent class cannot be made public in child class , but the protected method in the parent class can be made public in the child class , and thus can be made more accessible .
final methods cannot be overridden
to call the parents class method from the overriding method use the super keyword 
dynamic mehtod dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time , rather than at the compile time
